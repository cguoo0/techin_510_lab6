# Techin-510_Lab6
This Lab6 is a practice of using LLM from google Gemini to create streamlit APP. Users can enter their destination information and travel preference to get tailored trip suggestions. I train the large language model to help the gemini work as a professional trip advisor to provide travel suggestions.

# Getting started
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

# What's included
- API key
- colab notebook about LLM training. I trained it to make work for trip suggestion based on time, number of travelers and travel members.
- travel planner based on users inputs, such as location, days of traveling, and their trip preference.
- Travel suggestions include their planing in a day and alternative plans based on their preference.
